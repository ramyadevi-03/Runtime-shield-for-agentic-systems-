# Centralized LLM-Agnostic Runtime Governance for Agentic Systems

The **Runtime Shield** is a high-performance, identity-aware gateway implementing **Centralized LLM-Agnostic Runtime Governance** designed to harden autonomous AI agents (such as Claude Desktop, custom chatbot agents, or corporate ReAct frameworks) against prompt injections, data exfiltration, and unauthorized tool use. 

It acts as a stateful, unified interception bridge between any AI client and its execution environment, enforcing **Zero-Trust** boundaries at runtime.

## 🛡️ 5-Layer Defense Framework

1.  **Identity & Auth (Layer 2):** Dual-factor verification using:
    *   **Keycloak (User Roles):** Dynamic JWKS-based RS256 signature and claims verification (`iss`, `exp`, `aud`).
    *   **SPIFFE/SPIRE (Workload Identity):** Strict cryptographic SVID client certificate verification (`X-SPIFFE-CERT`) attested against the local CA trust bundle (`ca.crt`).
2.  **Policy Firewall (Layer 3):** Real-time tool-call inspection against `mcp-firewall.yaml` to block directory traversal and unauthorized path access.
3.  **Fraud Engine (Layer 4):** Behavioral risk scoring that automatically quarantines agents displaying suspicious or repetitive attack patterns.
4.  **Privacy Router (Layer 5):** In-flight PII redaction (Microsoft Presidio + Regex) that scrubs emails and secrets from tool outputs before the AI can see them.
5.  **Infrastructure Isolation (Layer 1):** Secure execution in isolated "Experiment Zones" and Docker-bound containers.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Node.js 18+**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **SPIRE** (for Workload Identity)

### 1. Setup Environment
Clone the repository and create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Update values for KEYCLOAK_URL, SPIFFE_BRIDGE_ID, and RUNTIME_ROLE
```

### 2. Launch Infrastructure
Start Keycloak, SPIRE Server, and SPIRE Agent:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Build the MCP Server
Install dependencies and compile the TypeScript source:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### 4. Run the Secure Bridge & Agent Demo
Start the entire integrated bridge, live dashboard, and Streamlit agent chatbot with one command:
```powershell
.\run_shield_demo.ps1
```

## 🧪 Security & Governance Verification

Verify the active security layers using the following programmatic test suites:

1. **Governance & Normalization Test:**
   ```powershell
   python scratch/test_governance_normalization.py
   ```
   *Validates case-insensitive tool normalization, SVID authentication, and zero-trust default-deny blocks on unknown tools.*

2. **Robust RBAC & Attestation Test:**
   ```powershell
   python scratch/test_robust_rbac.py
   ```
   *Validates that header-only SPIFFE requests are blocked cryptographically, and that verified standard users are blocked by NeMo/RBAC policies when requesting admin operations.*

3. **PII Redaction Test:**
   ```powershell
   python scratch/test_redaction.py
   ```
   *Validates Presidio-based in-flight redaction of sensitive outputs (emails, credit cards) before they reach the LLM.*

## 📊 Security Dashboard
Once the bridge is active, you can monitor all tool calls, risk levels, and redactions in real-time:

## ⚙️ Configuration & Architecture Guides
- **Centralized Governance Walkthrough:** [centralized_governance_walkthrough.md](file:///c:/Users/Lenovo/Desktop/Runtime-shield-%20login/Runtime-shield-for-agentic-systems/document/centralized_governance_walkthrough.md) — Comprehensive guide detailing unified tool normalization, cryptographic JWKS/SVID verification, Llama Guard bypass optimization, and RBAC rules.
- **Firewall Rules:** Modify `mcp-firewall.yaml` to define tool permissions and path guardrails.
- **Roles:** Set `RUNTIME_ROLE=user` or `admin` in your `.env` to test different RBAC personas dynamically.
